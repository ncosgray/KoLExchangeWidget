### Android app to show The Kingdom of Loathing exchange rate

**An Economist is You!**

As the only direct financial link between The Kingdom of Loathing and a real-world economy, the Mr. Accessory (an in-game item received in return for donating $10 to the game maintainers) is the perfect indicator by which to measure the current exchange rate. These items are commonly used to amass great in-game wealth; players donate to receive a Mr. A and then sell it in the mall for millions of meat. The KoL exchange rate can therefore be calculated by finding the cheapest current asking price for a Mr. A and dividing this value by 10 to find the $1 conversion factor.

This neat-o app for your Android telephone doesn't do anything except show you the exchange rate! In case you always wanted to do that!

Open the app to see today's exchange rate and a graph of recent activity. Or, long-press your home screen to add the KoL Exchange Rate widget, which will refresh daily with the current exchange rate. Tons more information, including historical graphs, can be found on the [KoL Exchange Rate website](https://www.nathanatos.com/#kol).

*Please note: This is not a game. Heck, it's barely even an app. And most importantly, we are not affiliated with The Kingdom of Loathing or Asymmetric Publications!*
