### Android Widget to fetch Kingdom of Loathing exchange rate

**An Economist is You!**

As the only direct financial link between The Kingdom of Loathing and a real-world economy, the Mr. Accessory (an in-game item received in return for donating $10 to the game maintainers) is the perfect indicator by which to measure the current exchange rate. These items are commonly used to amass great in-game wealth; players donate to receive a Mr. A and then sell it in the mall for millions of meat. The KoL exchange rate can therefore be calculated by finding the cheapest current asking price for a Mr. A and dividing this value by 10 to find the $1 conversion factor.

This neat-o widget for your Android telephone doesn't do anything except show you the exchange rate! In case you always wanted to do that!

Once installed, long-press your home screen to add the KoL Exchange Widget. It will refresh daily with the current exchange rate. Tap the widget to get more information, including historical graphs, from the [KoL Exchange Rate website](https://www.nathanatos.com/kol-exchange-rate/).

*Please note: This is not a game. And most importantly, we are not affiliated with The Kingdom of Loathing or Asymmetric Publications!*
