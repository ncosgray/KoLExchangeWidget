### Android Widget to fetch Kingdom of Loathing exchange rate

**"An Economist is You!"**

As the only direct financial link between The Kingdom of Loathing and a real-world economy, the Mr. Accessory (an in-game item received in return for donating $10 to the game maintainers) is the perfect indicator by which to measure the current exchange rate. These items are commonly used to amass great in-game wealth; players donate to receive a Mr. A and then sell it in the mall for upwards of 4 million meat. The KoL exchange rate can therefore be calculated by finding the cheapest current asking price for a Mr. A and dividing this value by 10 to find the $1 conversion factor.

This neat-o widget for your Android telephone doesn't do anything except show you today's exchange rate! In case you always wanted to do that, now you can -- add it to *your* home screen today.

Once installed, long-press your home screen to add the KoL Exchange Widget. Tap the widget to get more information, including historical graphs.

*Please note: This is not a game and it is not really any fun at all. And most importantly, we are not affiliated with The Kingdom of Loathing or Asymmetric Publications!*
